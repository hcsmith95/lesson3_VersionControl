## Project Description:
In this assignment, we learned what a version control system is, and why they're important to use, not only for developers, but for almost anyone. We've also learned how to create a Github account, as well as how to push any and all files we may want to the Github repository. 
## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Git Add: When using the Git Add command, you're adding all the files you've updated, since you're last backup, to the staging area, which is kind of like a temporary storage area, which gives the user a second chance to double check which files they'll upload, just in case the user wants to add any more files before officially committing them to the repository. 
2. Git Commit: The Git Commit command commits all the files that are in the staging area, and moves them to the local repository that is being used.  
3. Git Push: The Git Push command accesses the local repository and pushes all the files in the local repository to the remote repository, in this case Github.
